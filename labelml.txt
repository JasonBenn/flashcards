Differential diagnosis?;;Bayesian diagnosing: updating probabilities of multiple possible diagnoses based on evidence;
Decision support tool for doctors;;Clinical decision support system;
Diabetic retinopathy?;;Diabetes leading to blindness. Vessels all fucked up. Hemorrhages/aneurysms, hard exudates, abnormal growth.;
Aneurysm?;;Blood vessel wall weakens, causes bulge.;
What do research group directors want?;;Faster and better imaging software, increased size of team.;
Feature matching?;;Stitching images together by identifying aspects of objects in the image that are less variant when you view them from different angles. Combination of feature maps = feature descriptor.;
Enlitic?;;DL for medical diagnoses. Jeremy Howard cofounded.;
Greg Corrado?;;Cofounder/Principal Scientist @ Google Brain. Interested in force multipliers for doctors (diagnoses, sort/update EHRs, help write doctor's reports).;
Mighty AI?;;Training data as a service for self-driving cars, $30M funding, ~$100M valuation;
CrowdFlower?;;Training data as a service.;
Squadrun?;;India-based, human-powered training data as a service.;
Arterys?;;First/only(?) FDA-approved radiology tool. Partnered with GE, a major manufacturer. Data stays in hospital. Graphical tool w/ labeling + DL;
Augmedix?;;Physicians wear Google Glass, remote scribe takes notes and updates EHR, dr signs off on notes.;
Polygon RNN?;;Predict polygons from clicks, 5-7x speedup w 80% agreement;
SynthMed?;;Hyperrealistic synthesized medical dataset. Segmented retinal images from DRIVE database.;
medGAN?;;Synthetic EHRs. Generally indistinguishable except for outliers (prostate cancer (male) + menopausal disorder in same record - could be weeded out with domain-specific rules). Great for avoiding privacy concerns.;
Training object class detectors with click supervision?;;Weakly supervised object localization: you click middle, it draws bbox. Big speedup;
Cut/Paste/Learn: Synthesis for Instance Detection;;Put real object instances on fake bgs, train. 90% synthetic data outperforms models trained on 100% real data!;
RGAN?;;Recurrent GAN, generates time series data w labels (trained early warning system on EHRs from ICUs). Models could train on 100% synthetic data, still generalize well (kinda like ImageNet), no privacy concerns, almost the same performance.;
Knowledge distillation?;;Use an ensemble of models' predictions to train a single model - faster inference, obfuscates training data used.;
Active learning?;;Decide which images to label next;
Online learning?;;Continually train model with new examples;
One-short learning?;;Use prior knowledge about categories (share features or parameters) to classify new objects with one example.;
Few-shot learning?;;Learn a good weight init so learning converges rapidly<br>Learn embeddings of examples that classify w linear model better.;
Weak supervision?;;Use clues.;
Pseudolabeling?;;Use predicted classes as if they were true labels;
Dual Generative Adversarial Networks?;;Generate synthetic segmentation masks, then another GAN converts to images. 1% diff in F1 score, awesome. Sidesteps privacy concerns.;
Athena health?;;EHR service "unbreak healthcare";
U-Net?;;Biomedical image segmentation that's fast and requires <30 examples. U-shaped architecture max-pools then deconvs. Use lots of biomedical-specific data aug (warping, fuzzy membranes). Foreground/background class.;
DCGAN?;;Deep conv GANs - generate realistic images.;
DiscoGAN?;;Cross-domain relations - handbags to shoes, horses to zebras;
How much does biomedical imaging cost?;;1-5 per X-ray, 25-30 per chest CT;
Clarifai?;;Image/video recognition API;
How much does MTurk/Squadrun cost?;;1c/image, 2c/bbox. MTurk more if you want to average responses.;
Radiology tooling?;;PowerScribe data input tool, images, EHR.;
Radiologist process?;;Identify spatial features & signal pattern compared to normal organ, differential diagnosis (radiographic score), then read EHR, revise (clinical score), write report.;
How do we incentivize data hoarders to let us train models on their data?;;;
Reminder: problem in healthcare data is not privacy. HIPAA allows for it. Problem is TRUTH.;;;

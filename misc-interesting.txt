Why does putting your palms over your ears, snapping your fingers on the back of your skull 40-50 times (making a loud, drumming noise), sometimes relieve tinnitus?;;Overworked muscles at the base of skull are common source of tinnitus & headaches. Suboccipital muscles are always on fighting gravity and looking at computers. Too much contraction makes them short and painful. Tapping muscles makes them contract (try your belly). Continual tapping causes the muscle to burn up its resources (electrolytes, ATP). When cells are depleted, they turn off. When enough turn off, muscle relaxes = pain relief.

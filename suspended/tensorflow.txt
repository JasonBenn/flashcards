What is a tensor?;;A matrix with an arbitrary # of dimensions. Lazily evaluated.;

What is tiling?;;When adding a 1D tensor to another, the 1D tensor is implicitly duplicated to match the other's shape.;

Why always specify dimension to reduce across in reduction operations?;;Because it could help you catch a sneaky tiling bug.;

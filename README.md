For use with Anki spaced repetition software.

The best learning happens when you make connections between things, not when you memorize facts. However, it can be really nice to have some specific kinds of knowledge (library APIs, paper titles & authors, vocab terms) available at the tip of your tongue - spaced repetition is great for this.

Hypocrisy disclaimer: some of these decks include concepts that I really wish I understood better. I have a theory that it's useful to memorize them anyway so I can use and build off of them even before I fully understand them. Sometimes these situations happen when you're drowing in new information and there's just not enough time to relate everything to each other.

Describe the Word2Vec skip gram architecture;;Train simple NN with 1 hidden layer to predict the middle word in a phrase.;

How is an autoencoders useful? They just pass inputs through a hidden layer and output the same thing, right?;;After training, you can use the hidden layer - it'll have learned useful features.;

Autoencoder vs variational autoencoder?;;VAE: loss function includes KL divergence between input encoding and Gaussian uniform vector;

Stochastic gradient descent vs gradient descent?;;Gradient descent: compute gradient for entire set.<br>Stochastic: approximate that gradient by selecting a random batch.;

Cosine distance vs Euclidean distance?;;Cosine = angle between vectors, Euclidean = distance. For high dim space (100s+), distance is meaningless because everything is "on the edge" of that space.;

Find the most similar vector?;;;sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors

sklearn.neighbors: NearestNeighbors vs LSHForest?;;Exact NN (n^2) vs approximate NN (nlog(n)) - locality sensitive hashing forests.;

Convert bcolz array into numpy array?;;Careful you have enough memory tho.;bcolz.open('thing.bc')[:]

Style target for style transfer?;;Gram matrix of image channels. Somehow removes location info, preserves texture info;

Dropout?;;Regularization technique. Analogous to training a large ensemble of small networks.

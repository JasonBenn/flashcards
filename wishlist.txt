PYTHON TODO:

DJANGO TODO:

Permissions systems in Python.

https://github.com/minervaproject/picasso/pull/2124

django.contrib.auth:
- permission bools (analogous to capabilities)
- groups: a label and bag of permissions for users
- "pluggable backend system"

components:
- django.contrib.auth: core of framework, including some default models (user?)
- django.contrib.contenttypes: "allows permissions to be associated to models"
    - Allows polymorphic relationships. On the object that can be associated with anything, do:
  content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType)
  object_id = models.PositiveIntegerField()
  content_object = generic.GenericForeignKey()
        - And on the things with comments, do comments = generic.GenericRelation('Comment')
    - works because the package automatically creates an instance of ContentType for each model you have, and provides methods for fetching the actual model given a ContentType instance. This way, with a FK to ContentType, an instance can relate

BIG IDEAS:
Model field reference:
Field attribute reference
Model _meta API
Related objects reference
Model class reference
Model Meta options
Model instance reference
QuerySet API reference
Lookup API reference
Query Expressions
Conditional Expressions
Database Functions

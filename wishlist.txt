This talk from Jan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKEveL55TY

- django.contrib.contenttypes: "allows permissions to be associated to models"
    - Allows polymorphic relationships. On the object that can be associated with anything, do:
  content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType)
  object_id = models.PositiveIntegerField()
  content_object = generic.GenericForeignKey()
        - And on the things with comments, do comments = generic.GenericRelation('Comment')
    - works because the package automatically creates an instance of ContentType for each model you have, and provides methods for fetching the actual model given a ContentType instance. This way, with a FK to ContentType, an instance can relate

Symmetric key vs public key systems?;Symmetric: identical private key.<br/>Public: one known to whole world, private key known only to one.

Two kinds of symmetric encryption?;Stream ciphers, block ciphers

How does a block cipher work?;Symmetric. Complete mapping of k bits to k random bits. Typically 64+ bits.

Prevent attacker from breaking block cipher by recognizing "HTTP/1.1" in two messages?;XOR each block w random bits before encrypting, send those bits in plaint text.<br/>First message contains the plaintext pattern: the "Initialization Vector"

How does public/private key encryption basically work?;To send a message to Bob: find his public key, encrypt w algorithm and key, only he can decrypt with his private key.

Problems introduced by public/private key encryption?;1) chosen-plaintext attack?<br/>2) Unlike symmetric encryption, we don't know who sent msg.

RSA & AES?;canonical public key & symmetrical key crypto<br/>RSA is expensive: often used to communicate secret session key for cheaper AES

Message integrity concerns?;actually came from sender, wasn't tampered with en route

5 properties of good cryptographic hash function?;FDISC<br/>Fast, Deterministic, Infeasible to get msg except by trying all msgs, Small changes make unrecognizable, Collisions unlikely<br/>MD5, SHA-1, SHA-3, BLAKE2

How are block ciphers typically implemented?;As functions.<br/>Would be too expensive to store mapping table of i.e. 2^64 mappings, so use function to simulate, seeded by key.<br/>Example: AES-128/256

What is an upper-tier ISP?;ISPs that provide access to end systems must also be interconnected. Examples: Level 3 Communications, AT&T, Sprint

What is the first packet switch in a wireless LAN called?;Access Point

What are the benefits of radio channels carrying signals in the electromagnetic spectrum?;They can penetrate walls and potentially travel long distances

What do Bluetooth, WiFi, and cellular networks have in common?;They all rely on radio waves (of various wavelengths)

What is a queueing delay?;Most packet switches use store-and-forward transmission at their inbound links, necessitating temporary storage of packets. Queueing delay occurs when an outgoing link is already busy transmitting other packets in an outgoing link queue.

How does a router map destination addresses (or portions thereof) to its outgoing links?;With a forwarding table.

What is ISP peering?;ISPs pay their upstream providers based on traffic. To save costs, they sometimes join their networks together directly. IXPs (Internet Exchange Points) are meeting points where multiple ISPs can peer.

At each node along a path, a packet suffers delays. What are the 4 most important kind of delays?;Nodal processing - examine headers, decide where to send it<div>Queueing - before transmitting on to a link</div><div>Transmission - link transmission rate / packet size</div><div>Propagation - propagation speed of the link</div>

When might transmission delay be a factor?;When broadcasting a large packet over a low transmission rate link it could be in the 100s of milliseconds. Typically negligible for transmission rates of 10+ Mbps.

When can propagation delay be a factor?;It can be 100s of milliseconds for two routers connected by geostationary satellite link. For routers in the same access network it'll be negligible - a couple microseconds.

Why is processing delay important?;It's negligible for an individual packet, but strongly influences a routers max throughput.

Virus vs worm?;Virus requires user interaction to infect the device, worms don't. (user might be running vulnerable application in which attacker can just send malware)

Three types of DoS attacks?;Vulnerability attack - send the right messages to a vulnerable app, make the app or the host crash<div>Bandwidth flooding - send tons of packets, legit packets are dropped</div><div>Connection flooding - bog them down with bogus TCP connections, host stops accepting legit connections.</div>

Best defense against packet sniffing?;Cryptography

Best defense against attackers masquerading as someone a host trusts?;End-point authentication, which allows us to say with certainty who is sending us packets.

<div>What protocol layer is SSL?</div>;"Trick question, it's not a protocol, it's just two application-level decorator functions for the TCP socket API.<div><br></div><div><span style=""font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"">(Sending host pushes data into SSL's socket-like API. SSL encrypts and pushes into TCP socket API. Receiving host receives data from TCP socket, passes to SSL socket-like API, decrypts, passes to application.)</span><br></div>"

What are some features that TCP implements that UDP does not?;Congestion control, flow control, reliable data transfer

The simplest tool to perform a load testing;ab (Apache Benchmarking tool)<div><br /></div><div><div>Execute 100 HTTP GET requests to given URL.</div><div>ab -n 100 {url}</div><div><br /></div><div>Execute 100 HTTP GET requests, processing up to 10 requests concurrently, to given URL.</div><div>ab -n 100 -c 10 {url}</div></div>

DNS lookup utility;dig<div><br /></div><div><div>Lookup the IP(s) associated with a hostname (A records)</div><div>dig +short {hostname.com}</div><div><br /></div><div>Specify an alternate DNS server to query (8.8.8.8 is google's public DNS)</div><div>dig @8.8.8.8 {hostname.com}</div></div>

Reads and writes TCP or UDP data;nc<div><br /></div><div><div>listen on a specified port</div><div>nc -l {port}</div><div><br /></div><div>connect to a certain port (you can then write to this port)</div><div>nc {ip_address} {port}</div><div><br /></div><div>serve a file<br /></div><div>cat somefile.txt | nc -l {port}</div><div><br /></div><div>receive a file</div><div>nc {ip_address} {port} &gt; somefile.txt</div></div>

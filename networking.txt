What is the core tradeoff in a distributed hash table?
The number of neighbors a peer has to track
The number of messages a peer must send to resolve a query ("Who is responsible for hashed key 13?")

What happens when a peer in a distributed hash table can't answer a query?
It hashes the question and asks a neighbor (a nearby peer) that might know the answer.

What is a BitTorrent tracker?
A distributed hash table of currently living peers.

How does the transport layer check for errors?
Sending host: checksum the packet, put in checksum header field
Receiving host: checksum the packet, add it to sending checksum, does it equal 11111111?

What are the well-known port numbers?
0 to 1023.
HTTP: 80
HTTPS: 443
SSH: 22

What's the relationship between ports and sockets?
TCP receives messages at a port, a demultiplexes them to a socket based on the 4-tuple (src-ip, src-port, dest-ip, dest-port)

How are UDP and TCP demultiplexing different?
TCP demultiplexing is complex - there can be many TCP sockets for a port. Identifiable by 4 tuple.
UDP demultiplexing is simpler - there's only ever one UDP socket for a port. Identifiable by (dest ip, dest port)

How does TCP determine a timeout interval?
A weighted moving average of estimated round-trip times between packet transmission and ACK, plus some multiple of the EstRTTs variance (like 4).

How many ports are there?
It's a 16 bit number, so 65,535 (0 counts).

Why does TCP set initial sequence numbers randomly during the 3-way handshake?
To reduce the probability that incorrect data is ACK'd - there could be stray packets still in the network from a previous, ended TCP connection between those two hosts and ports.

What's the difference between flow control and congestion control?
Flow control: don't let sender overwhelm receiver (receiving application is slow reading data from the receiving buffer)
Congestion control: don't let sender overwhelm network

What problem does the Go-Back-N protocol solve?
Identifying missing data. Go-Back-N implementers ACK the last in-order received byte, even if they've received later bytes, out-of-order.
(Most TCP implementers ACK missing segments selectively, as it requires less network traffic)

Flow control: what does the sender need to know from the client to make overflowing the receiving buffer impossible?
The receiving buffer's free space - the amount of unacknowledged data in the network (LastByteSent - LastByteAcked)

What is included in a SYN packet?
Client's random initial sequence number
SYN bit = 1

What happens when a TCP server receives a SYN packet?
1. Allocates a buffer and a port for the connection
2. Set the acknowledgment field to client's initial sequence number + 1
3. Chooses its own ISN

How does the client respond to a SYNACK packet?
1. Allocates a buffer and port for the connection
2. Sets the acknowledgment field to the server's initial sequence number + 1
2. Optionally sends data.

What are the 6 flag bits in a TCP packet's header?
SYN
RST
FIN
ACK (acknowledgment number field is valid)
URG (urgent, not used)
PSH (pass to application layer now, not used)

What is the conditional GET?
A request that might return 304 Not Modified.
Caching could be implemented using:
Date modified (Resp: Last-Modified, Req: If-Modified-Since)
ETags (Req: If-None-Match, Resp: ETag)
Cache-Control (Req+Res: "Cache-Control: max-age=120").

"Why use 2-part commit over Raft?<br>Raft requires less nodes to confirm!";;2 part commit requires everyone agree<br>Raft only requires majority agree<br>As a result, in Raft only leader can do reads or writes<br>2PC/3PC = anyone can read or write.;

Why are writes so much more expensive than reads?;;Don't need to be transactional, just consistent. They come from memory after the first read.;

How much to read 1MB sequentially from memory?;;250,000 ns (4GB/sec);

Execute typical instruction?;;1 ns (1B/sec);

Fetch from L1 cache memory?;;0.5 ns (2B/sec);

Branch misprediction?;;5 ns;

Fetch from L2 cache memory?;;7 ns;

Fetch from main memory?;; 100 ns (.0001 ms) (100,000,000/sec);

Send 2K bytes over 1Gbps network;; 20,000 ns (.02 ms) (50k/sec);

Fetch from new disk location (seek);; 8,000,000 ns (8 ms) (~100/sec);

Read 1MB sequentially from disk?;;20,000,000 ns (20 ms);

Size of average packet?;;1500 bytes, max size: 65k;

Subdivisions of second?;;milli (-3), micro (-6), nano (-9), pico (-12), femto (-15) (time for light to travel across a virus);

Packet round trip from US to Europe?;;150,000,000 ns (150 ms) (6/sec);

Mutex lock/unlock;;25 ns;

Write vs read speed?;;Reads are ~40x faster;

How to optimize a distributed system that's bottlenecked by heavily written objects?;;Optimize for low write contention, and spread writes out wide.;

What should you be thinking about when architecting a system?;;Scaling writes.;

How to think of eigenvectors?;;The vectors that stay on their own span during a transformation.;

Nonstandard approach: feedback! "It’s insane to me that we’ve gotten this far with pure feedforward approaches. Dynamical systems are very efficient, adaptive learning machines."

Why do word embeddings work by counting context words?;;Because the meaning of "club" in "a ___ walked into a club" depends on if ___ is "DJ" or "baby seal".;

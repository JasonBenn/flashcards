--- TO DO ---

AWS:
stack (dev prod). has many layers.
layer = collection of instances. expand and contract as needed. has recipes.
instances (potentially many instances in an app)

apps (seminar, schools) (within stacks) doesn't support django so we don't really use it. they're just labels.

figure out which file opsworks is logging into
ps fauxw, look for the line with tee

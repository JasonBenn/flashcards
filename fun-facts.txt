How does the wash sale rule help you avoid capital gains taxes?;;Because your capital gains tax basis is net (your gains - your losses), you can sell a stock that's losing to reduce your tax burden (because it will be counted as a loss and offset your income from gains).

What is early exercising and an 83b election?;;Early exercising allows you to exercise options and pay taxes on them before they vest (you elect to do this with the 83b).<br>Normally you have to wait until they vest for you to exercise, and that's when taxes are assessed.<br>This way you can pay taxes up-front so that you avoid paying higher income tax from exercising later.<br>This just minimizes one of the two ways options are taxed.

Why does putting your palms over your ears, snapping your fingers on the back of your skull 40-50 times (making a loud, drumming noise), sometimes relieve tinnitus?;;Overworked muscles at the base of skull are common source of tinnitus & headaches. Suboccipital muscles are always on fighting gravity and looking at computers. Too much contraction makes them short and painful. Tapping muscles makes them contract (try your belly). Continual tapping causes the muscle to burn up its resources (electrolytes, ATP). When cells are depleted, they turn off. When enough turn off, muscle relaxes = pain relief. This is how trigger point therapy/myofascial release work.;

What are the three parts of an index for a numpy matrix?;;slice start, slice end, stride;

What happens when you index one dimension with tensors and not the others?;;The others are broadcast to match dimensions, if possible, then mapped.;

Indexing: select in full from unspecified dimensions?;;Use the Ellipsis object literal;y[..., :2, :2]

Difference between list and collections.deque (double-ended queue)?;;lists are arrays (O(1) for random access and approx O(1) for appending, O(N) for prepending)<br>deques are doubly-linked lists (O(1) push and pop from both ends).<br>deque also has maxlen, which shifts items off the front when a push would exceed it;

What are common reasons for a segfaults in Python?;;Binary module & library version mismatch<br>C extension (or Cython) is broke;

How does IPython's %debug magic work?;;IPython keeps a process hanging around for the last exception, and %debug can connect to it later.;

How are Python debuggers implemented?;;sys.settrace is used to set the system's trace function for the current thread, this function is then invoked with every line and exception. A debugger process runs in the background with breakpoints in mind, when those lines are hit, it opens a REPL.;

What is PyDevd?;;A high-performance debugger that handles settrace calls and decides what to do. Pydev is fast because it disables tracing entirely for contexts with no breakpoints!;

Why is Pandas chained indexing bad?;df[df.C <= 0].ix[:,'B':'E'] = 2;Because the get indexer will often (but not always!) return a view, and the set indexer will operate in place.;df[df.C <= 0, 'B':'E'] = 2

When does Pandas copy?;;(subsequent rules override).<br>1. Always.<br>2. Except if inplace=True.<br>3. Get/set indexers have their own rules;

When do Pandas indexers return copies, and when do they return views?;;Set indexers (.loc[], .iloc[], .at[]): views (in-place).<br>Get indexers on single-dtyped frames: views (mostly).<br>Get indexers on multi-dtyped frames: copies.;
